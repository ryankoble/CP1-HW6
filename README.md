DESCRIPTION:
My program grows a design out from the x-axis in the center, while a gentle song in the key of C plays in the background. Using the top row '1' to '=' keys, you can play tones that are tuned to the key of C. The designs grow more as those tones are played. If proper chords are played, the design grow exponentially. Eventually the song times out and the drawing stops growing.

I still need to add sounds to each key, and add the song in the background. I also may change the values of each key to create better combination with results that work a bit better in the drawing.
